My Mom received a gift from one of my Dad's boss's wife. It was a stuffed animal teddy bear. She received this gift a couple of months or so before she passed.

Her and I were the only ones present and sitting on the couch when she opened the gift. After she opened it, she started crying hysterically while hugging the teddy bear. I've never seen my Mom make such an attachment to a stuffed animal before. She immediately called the gift provider and thanked her while still crying.

This was one of the more emotional and interesting things I noticed. To me, that teddy bear resembles my Mom now. It's something precious in my opinion and it reminds me a lot of her.
