Today was filled with more ups and downs. I didn't sleep as good (6 hours), but I made it by without feeling too tired.

There was still a lot of stress from the move since we're taking it day by day. I've also been experiencing a lot of mood swings and random points of fatigue. I've also been finding myself wanting to be more alone, but at least the same time I don't want to be alone. It's so hard to explain, but I think it's common when grieving.

Late at night (right before writing this actually), I was sent more pictures of my Mom and I from my childhood by my Sister. I went through them and instantly broke down (which was the most intense break-down I've had in the last week and a half). While it was incredibly painful, I'm glad I did since feeling emotionally numb to everything has honestly felt worse.
