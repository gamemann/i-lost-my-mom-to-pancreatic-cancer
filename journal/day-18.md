Today has its ups and downs. For one, I slept really good last night and continued to take care of myself. Experiencing a few more things that I believe is due to the medication I started (my teeth and gums have been hurting which is a common side effect from my medication that I read). There was a point today where I felt really good to be honest, but that was short-lived and tonight has been rougher than previous nights. I still haven't cried the last few days, but I still feel so much pain which was more severe tonight.

It doesn't help I'm still stressed about the moving situation which is happening this week. It has been hard to keep these journal updates up-to-date just from everything going on.
