**Journal Entry Started At 9:58 PM EST on June 19th**

No notable events really occurred today. Still taking care of myself and slept decently. I still have a lot of fatigue which I'd imagine is just from the emotional toll the events took along with preparing to move. Also still feeling emotionally numb and get sad/flashbacks whenever I go outside of my room in the house.

I did start packing up my room which has kept me distracted. Still need to go to the house and confirm my window AC unit I paid a lot of money for last year fits in the new house's windows which has been giving me anxiety.
