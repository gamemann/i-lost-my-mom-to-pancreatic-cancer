**Journal Entry Started At 1:48 PM EST on July 1st**

I decided not to make journal entries the last few days since I've been very busy and stressed moving to my new home (so many things with the new home causing additional stress I won't go into detail here). The last few days have been stressful, incredibly sad, and also a little exciting. I'm basically saying bye to my childhood home of 24 years and also saying bye to so many memories of my Mom, my family, and I.

I was emotionally numb for the most part up until the last two days or so after I was starting to settle into the new home. I've been really missing my Mom and I've been having more dreams of her more recently which sucks right now. It's such a crazy feeling knowing I probably won't step foot into my old home again.

My last senior dog hasn't been adjusting well to the move as well (we had a vet come over and are trying some things), but I know in the next month or so we're going to have to sadly put her down as well. That'll be really sad given that's the last animal tie to my Mom and I've already went through so many deaths in a short amount of time.

At least we were able to still get FIOS/fiber in the new home so that's nice.
