I didn't get as much sleep as I've been getting. Only got around 6 and a half hours of sleep. Still taking care of myself.

I spent a lot of the day packing and keeping my mind off of things. I still have sad thoughts, but it wasn't as bad as previous days.

My nephew came over later and will sleep the night so the house feels a bit less quiet than it normally is nowadays.
