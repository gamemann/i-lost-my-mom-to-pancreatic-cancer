The last few days have been okay. I've had more downs than ups, but I've stuck with my daily routine. I was also sick a couple of days ago which sucked, but it didn't last long and I was still able to do everything I needed to do.

I've been also eating one - two apples daily which is good I believe. I'm going to be improving my diet very soon which should help things even further.

The downs causes weren't any different than before. However, I do feel like the pain from grieving has been getting worse. Balling my eyes out used to help a lot, but it isn't doing anything as much I find. I want to so bad go back to how I felt before my Mom died. The comfort I had without even really realizing it. I've talked to a few friends who also had a parent pass away who are around the same age and they agree it just feels like the world is a much darker place afterwards.

At least I'm starting to get more settled into the new house. My nephew came over this past weekend and it was nice spending time with him.
