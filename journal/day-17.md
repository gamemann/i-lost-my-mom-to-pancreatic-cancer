Today was a better day overall. Didn't sleep all that great, but had fun with some hobbies.

There were still definitely moments of sadness though. More stuff from the house was moved out and my childhood home really is looking empty now. It doesn't help that a lot of things in the house have broken down over the last 24 years without being fixed due to reasons I won't go into here. It's really just a sad and weird feeling with everything that happened. Putting one of my senior dogs, finding a new home for a newer dog we got a while back, to my Mom's passing and now moving out of my childhood house all within the span of a few weeks. Crazy how things can change so quickly.
