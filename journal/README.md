This is a list of my public journal entries for each day after my Mom passed. These are intended to be informal as I'm just spilling out thoughts. I don't work on every journal entry the day they happen, so it's possible I forget things since everything feels so blurry.

I know it's a bit odd to have public journal entries, but I'm really hoping they'll help somebody some day going through grief as well. Knowing there's a chance these entries may help others makes writing public journal entries worth it in my eyes.
