This is a list of my public journal entries for each day after my Mom passed. These are intended to be informal and personal as I'm just spilling out thoughts. I don't work on every journal entry the day they happen, so it's possible I forget things since everything feels so blurry.

I know it's odd to have public journal entries, but I'm really hoping they'll help somebody some day going through grief as well. Knowing there's a chance these entries may help others makes writing public journal entries worth it in my eyes. Plus just writing my thoughts done helps make me feel like I'm not so alone I guess and there's a chance somebody else could relate to the feelings after experiencing the loss of a loved one.
