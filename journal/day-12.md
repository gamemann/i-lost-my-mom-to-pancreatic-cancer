Today was more of the same as recent days. I've been taking care of myself, but still have that horrible dark feeling has been overwhelming me. I'm still trying to face these thoughts and get over them, but it's going to take a lot of time. I've been continuing to distract myself and also talk to people about my Mom's story and such.

I watched the Phillies game with my Dad for a couple of hours tonight as well (they lost!). After I came upstairs, for the first time in a while I updated a couple of my popular GitHub projects and responded to an issue.

I also found my Mom's teddy bear in the garage after the funeral yesterday. So I took it and put it in my room. It makes me feel a little more comfortable having it in my room since it makes me feel a little bit closer to my Mom. I did cry a bit after placing it down in my room, but other than that have still been emotionally numb. Received more progress on the house we're moving into which has been exciting (they put carpet in the upstairs rooms which is where I'll be!).
