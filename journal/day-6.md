**Journal Entry Started At 9:59 AM EST on June 11th**

I woke up and had a great nights of sleep (9 hours and 1 minute with 1+ hours of REM sleep and 1+ hours of deep sleep according to my watch). I had really weird dreams and I think my Mom was in them at some point, but once again I just can't remember them (probably a good thing).

It's my Dad's birthday today which is probably really hard for him. I called him and wished him happy birthday. I'm sure he wishes my Mom was here to celebrate with all of us. My brother's friends are coming over in the afternoon to help throw a bunch of heavy stuff out in the house (since we're moving out soon). I think I'm going to go to the house we're moving into and see the progress (they're completely redoing the house).
