I got even better sleep than the previous nights which is surprising. My average heart rate on my watch has dropped by 10 (70 -> 60) over the last week which is also weird, but no cause of concern. I had many dreams, but I don't remember them mostly. I don't remember my Mom being in any of them this time (at least yet).

It has been a week since my Mom has passed. It has felt like the slowest, but fastest week of my life and the most painful I've ever experienced. I still can't believe it.

I ate pretty well today and just distracted myself. I spent hours with my Dad as well since I know that makes him feel better. His birthday was just a couple of days ago and Father's Day is coming up, it must be really rough going through those holidays without my Mom.

The last couple of days have been really rough. I still haven't been able to cry, but I just feel like my heart was ripped out of my chest. I feel this horrible sadness around me. It's such a weird feeling and I haven't felt it before. It could be the feeling of becoming numb I suppose. I don't know, never experienced or shared how I'm feeling until writing this.

Anyways, going to head to bed soon.
