I got even better sleep than the previous nights which is surprising. My average heart rate on my watch has dropped by 10 (70 -> 60) over the last week which is also weird, but no cause of concern. I had many dreams, but I don't remember them mostly. I don't remember my Mom being in any of them this time (at least yet).

It has been a week since my Mom has passed. It has felt like the slowest, but fastest week of my life and the most painful I've ever experienced. I still can't believe it.
